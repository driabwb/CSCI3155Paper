# CSCI 3155 Rough Draft

### Introduction

This paper discusses Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 3104: Access to names in outer scopes.

### What is the PEP?

### Why implement this PEP?

In Python, one can declare functions within functions, which gives the appearance of a nested lexical scope. However, before this PEP one could not actually modify variables not in the immediate local scope, which defied the intuition of many programmers who expected it. For instance, in this code, taken from the PEP proposal site: [1]

~~~~~
def make_scoreboard(frame, score=0):
    label = Label(frame)
    label.pack()
    for i in [-10, -1, 1, 10]:
        def increment(step=i):
            score = score + step  # fails with UnboundLocalError
            label['text'] = score
        button = Button(frame, text='%+d' % i, command=increment)
        button.pack()
    return label
~~~~~

Here, a programmer used to nested lexical scoping would assume the ability to modify the score variable in the nested function. However, Python did not support this functionality until this PEP was implemented in Python 3.

### Community reaction

Since PEP 227, there has been talk in the community of addressing the issue of reassigning free variables within a nested scope. As Almann T. Goo writes in the Python-Dev mailing list:

~~~~~
"My rationale is that with the advent of PEP 227 <http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0227.html>, Python has proper  
nested lexical scopes, but can have undesirable behavior (especially with new developers) when a user makes  
wants to make an assignment to a free variable within a nested function." [2]
~~~~~

In general, there was agreement that this quirk of the language was problematic, and many replies echoed this concern: "The lack of support for rebinding names in enclosing scopes is certainly a wart." [3]

Almann suggests the keyword "use" in this message quoted above, and in the course of the conversation more are suggested as well, including "outer", "extern", "common", and many others.

In the discussion thread, there were fewer arguments against the new proposal than for it. One lines of the arguments against it seemed to be against nested scoping in general:

~~~~~
"Introducing these two new keywords is equivalent to encouraging nested scope use.  Right now nested scope use  
is "limited" or "fraught with gotchas".  Adding the 'use' and 'scope' keywords to label levels of scopes for  
name resolution will only encourage users to write closures which could have written better or not written  
at all..." [4]
~~~~~

Other objections cite that there are not enough non-trivial use cases to warrent a new keyword, especially considering there are already ways to work around the issue by using classes to declare a kind of namespace [4]. But despite the resistance to this proposal, at the end of the day it seemed to be a need that a critical mass of people could not let go of, as summarized by Guido in this quote:

~~~~~
"I think the needs are actually pretty simple. Python currently doesn't allow assignment to variables in an outer  
non-global scope, and people have shown by their behavior that they cannot get used to this (otherwise the debate  
would have fizzled by now)." [5]
~~~~~

- [ ] Insert here maybe some rationale about why the current solution is best?
